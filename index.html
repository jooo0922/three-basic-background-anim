      배경에 three.js 애니메이션을 넣는 방법

      1. 원래는 transparent_canvas 예제처럼 캔버스의 position: fixed로 지정하고,
      z-index: -1 로 설정해서 캔버스 자체를 전체 요소들보다 뒤로 빼줘도 배경으로 지정할 수 있음.
      근데 이렇게 하면 three.js를 렌더링하는 js 코드와 현재 페이지가 반드시 통합되어 있어야 한다는 점.
      만약이 페이지가 캔버스 외에 복잡한 요소가 많고, 그 요소들에 대해서도 js 코드로 이것저것 처리해줘야 할 게 많다면
      three.js를 렌더링하는 코드와 충돌하지 않도록 신경써서 작성해줘야 하는 불편함이 있음.

      2. 반면 iframe을 사용하는 방법도 있는데
      얘는 three.js를 렌더링하는 js코드가 현재 페이지랑 통합될 필요가 없이,
      three.js가 렌더링되는 페이지의 url만 iframe에 추가해주면 되니까 쉽고 간단함.
      다만, iframe을 비롯한 프레임구조는 현재는 사용되지 않는 추세이고, W3C 에서도 사용하지 말것을 권고하고 있음.
      게다가 메모리 및 컴퓨터 자원을 잡아먹거나, 보안 위험, 사용성 문제, 유지보수의 어려움, 검색엔진이 크롤링하지 못하는 점 등 단점이 너무 많기 때문에...
      물론 three.js만 렌더링하는 페이지를 삽입하는 거라면 상관없긴 하겠지만 사용 시 이런 점들을 고려할 필요는 있을 것 같다.

      <h1>Beautiful Cubes</h1>
      <p>
        <!-- <b>태그는 bold 처리를 해주는 태그 -->
        <b>Cubes are beautiful</b>. You can have an entire planet of them, for
        instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        How cool is that? (A bit confusing, honestly. I have always felt as
        though cubes had a tendency to be a little too cool and overly
        realistic. Like an endless collection of super-realistic robots… But I
        guess it is part of what makes them so interesting.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So maybe there's a limit to what the human imagination can do for me.
      </p>
      <p>That can't hurt.</p>
      <p>Well then… let's break it down.</p>
      <p>Stardust</p>
      <p>
        I know a lot of you are saying: You can't, because you will get stuck
        with something that's "too realistic." Well, I have a very real
        suggestion: Just don't be that dude. In fact, let's be very specific: If
        you have to do something, let the actual thing change. If it's a little
        weird to have a space ship, or a spaceship you have to fly, or … well,
        you probably already are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forget about all of the sci-fi stuff. Space. No sense hiding that from
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space in my own home was never real-world. It was never something
        that a person might have done. It was something that only seemed
        plausible to me. There was only one "space craft," and if you could
        figure
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Cubes are beautiful</b>. Don't underestimate a nice stack of cubes.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decide to stack more than one cube, don't forget to use a stack
        of cubes as a guide to follow to make a tight fit. If a bunch of cubes
        are stacked too close together, the edges will stick out which will make
        for a tight fit!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, if you decide you don't want to stack your boxes you can
        place another stack of cubes along the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you are done! The process is super simple and simple it's the easy
        stuff to set up.
      </p>
      <p>But what if you don't like the size of the boxes?</p>
      <p>
        You see, in the old days, a box was a solid block of wood, plastic or
        ceramic with an outer layer of cardboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 1990s, wood became the new material and in this method, the
        cardboard and wood are joined together so that they can both become a
        floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        But some people don't like to use just the plastic/carpet layer. And
        with those people, these cubes are more likely to get wet.
      </p>
      <p>So how does this stack?</p>
